# MATLAB Simulation: Thrust Vector Control for Model Rocket

## Overview

This MATLAB project focuses on simulating the trajectory of a model rocket equipped with thrust vector control. The simulation is designed to showcase the dynamics and control mechanisms involved in guiding the rocket during flight. The project is currently in progress, with a basic trajectory simulation already implemented using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Features

- **Trajectory Simulation:** A basic simulation of the model rocket's trajectory, accounting for gravitational forces, aerodynamics, and initial launch conditions.

- **thrust Vector Control:** Integration of thrust vector control principles to dynamically adjust the rocket's orientation during flight.

- **MATLAB & Simulink:** The simulation is implemented using MATLAB and Simulink for a comprehensive analysis of the rocket's behaviour.

## Project Structure

- `MMOICalculation.m`: MATLAB script containing the main simulation logic.
- `TVCSimulationForMyModel.slx`: Simulink model for trajectory simulation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamnarendrans/TVCSimulation.git
```

2. Open `MMOICalculation.m` in MATLAB to run the simulation.

3. Explore the Simulink model (`TVCSimulationForMyModel.slx`) for a detailed view of the simulation setup.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020b or later.
- Simulink Toolbox.

## Future Work

The project is currently on hold. Future enhancements include:

- Fine-tuning thrust vector control parameters.
- Implementing a more detailed rocket model using Simscape Multibody.
