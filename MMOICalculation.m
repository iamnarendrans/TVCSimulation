% Calculation Mass Moment of Inertia
% Every Mass units in Kilogram(Kg) and distance units in meter(m) and time
% in seconds(s)

% Constant Values
g = 9.81;
pi = 3.14159265359;
%% Mass of the rocket (body)
M_b = 0.543;   
%% Distance from the Cg to test the periodic oscillation
C_s = 0.3;
%%  Length of the string tied to find Cg
L_s = 0.65;
%% Moment arm distance - i.e distance between TVC mount & Cg
D_m = 0.28;
%% Period of oscillation - Done 10 oscillation
T_s = 16.03;
TAvg_s = 1.063;
%% Mass Moment of Inertia calculation
MMOI = (M_b * g * TAvg_s^2 * C_s^2) / (4^2 * pi^2 * L_s);
